Overview
========

This is a skeleton no-op driver, meant for tutorial purposes.
It will be dynamically imported by ysi.

At the driver level, Blockstack expects a key/value store.  If a user
does a `put`, then the data stored should be readable by any other
user that does a `get` on the same key.  Blockstack itself chooses what
the keys are; they are *not* derived from the data.

To see what is expected, consider the following example:

   Suppose Alice and Bob both use a Blockstack-powered blogging application.
   When Alice writes a new blog post, the blogging application asks
   Blockstack to save it.  The app gives the blogpost the application-chosen name
   "alice_2017-05-30-15:05:30", and passes both the name and data into
   Blockstack.  Blockstack calls into its storage drivers and saves the
   data to each underlying storage service.

   When Bob goes to read Alice's blog, his client discovers that the
   new blog post is called "alice_2017-05-30-15:05:30".  His client
   then asks Blockstack to load up the blogpost's contents.  Bob's
   storage drivers use the name "alice_2017-05-30-15:05:30" to look
   up and fetch the blog data from each service.

   Later, Alice decides to delete "alice_2017-05-30-15:05:30". When
   Bob goes to read Alice's blog, his client again fetches the blogpost
   titled "alice_2017-05-30-15:05:30".  Since Alice has removed the
   data from her storage providers, none of Bob's drivers return the
   blogpost data.

Background
==========

Blockstack storage drivers are responsible for implementing
a get/put/delete interface for two logical types of I/O:
mutable data, and immutable data.

Mutable data is data that does NOT touch the underlying blockchain.
Instead, mutable data is signed by a private key derived from
the keypair listed in the user's zone file.  Most user data
(profiles, application data stores) follows the mutable data
I/O model, since mutable I/O can happen as fast as the storage
service allows.

Immutable data is data that touches the underlying blockchain.
Each 'put' and 'delete' corresponds to an on-chain transaction
(specificially, a NAME_UPDATE transaction that modifies the user's
zone file).  Similarly, each 'get' corresponds to a previously-sent
transaction.  Immutable data is appropriate for storing data that
will only be written once, where freshness, integrity, and consistency
are more important than I/O performance (examples include storing
PGP keys, software releases, and certificates).

In practice, most storage drivers can implement the mutable I/O
path and immutable I/O path the same way; the only difference
between the two will be the interfaces.  For example, the `disk`
driver simply stores everything to disk, immutable or mutable.

Replication Strategy
====================

Replication in Blockstack is best-effort.  On a given `put`, some data may
be successfully replicated to some storage providers, and some data may not.
Blockstack automatically masks any inconsistencies that get introduced
(see Responsibilities below).

Blockstack uses three configuration fields in its config file to
determine how to replicate data.

    * ysi-client.storage_drivers.  This is the list of storage drivers
    to use to both read and write data.  All of these drivers will be attempted
    on any `get` or `put`.  A `get` or `put` is attempted on each driver in the 
    order they are listed (but this may change in the future).

    * ysi-client.storage_drivers_required_write.  This is the list of
    storage drivers that must successfully `put` data in order for a write
    to succeed.  If even one of them fails, the entire write fails.

    * ysi-client.storage_drivers_local.  This is the list of drivers that
    keep their data invisible to other clients.  For example, the `disk` driver
    is listed here by default since writes to disk are invisible to other clients.

In order for `put` to work on mutable data, there must be at least one driver listed in
ysi-client.storage_drivers_required_write that is NOT listed in
ysi-client.storage_drivers_local.

There are no long-term plans for creating more sophisticated replication strategies.  This
is because more sophisticated strategies can be implemented as "meta drivers" that load
existing drivers as modules, and forward `get` and `put` requests to them according to the
desired strategy.

Access Strategy
===============

It is up to the storage drivers to not only store the data given
to them, but also to store any metadata required to later translate
the app-given name back into the data that was previously stored.
Moreover, once data is stored in Blockstack, *any* user with the
data's name should be able to read it.

Some storage systems make this easy.  For example, the `disk` and `s3`
drivers achieve this simply by storing the data under the name given
by the application.  Using the example in the Overview section, the 
blogpost data for "alice_2017-05-30-15:05:30" can simply be stored as 
a file or object with the name "alice_2017-05-30-15:05:30".

This is less easy for storage systems like Dropbox, where the storage
system creates its own URI for each piece of data stored.  In these cases,
the driver must build and maintain an index over all of the data stored,
so it can later translate the app-given name (i.e. "alice_2017-05-30-15:05:30")
back into the service-given URI (i.e. "https://www.dropbox.com/s/pa4lugfa8yiuoio/profile.json?dl=1")
on `get`.

For indexing, driver developers are encouraged to use the following methods
from `common.py` to build a co-located index:

    * `get_indexed_data()`: loads data from the storage by translating an
    app-given name into a service-specific URI.
    * `put_indexed_data()`: stores data with a given name into the storage
    system, and inserts an entry for it in an index alongside the data.
    * `delete_indexed_data()`: removes data with a given name from the storage
    system, and updates the co-located index to remove its name-to-URI link.
    * `index_setup()`: instantiates an index (callable from the driver's
    `storage_init()` method).
    * `driver_config()`: sets up callbacks to be used by the indexer code
    for loading and storing both data and pages of the index.

Please see the docstrings for each of these methods in the `common.py` file.

Responsibilities
================

Blockstack handles a lot of higher-level storage responsibilities on its
own, so the driver implementer can focus on interfacing with the storage
provider and/or creating the desired replication strategy.  The responsibilities
are divided as follows:

    * Consistency.  Blockstack takes care of writing immutable data
    hashes to the zone file, and takes care of maintaining consistency info
    for mutable data.  Specifically:
    
        * Blockstack guarantees per-key monotonic read consistency
        for mutable data (i.e. a `get` on a key returns the same or newer data as
        the previous `get` on the same key, but does not guarantee that the `get` returns
        the same data written by the last `put` on it).
        
        * A correct driver must guarantee per-key read-your-writes
        consistency (i.e. a `put` followed by a `get` on the same key 
        should return the last-`put` data to the local client).
        
        * It is acceptable to rely on the storage system to enforce consistency.
        For example, most cloud storage providers claim to offer per-key sequential
        consistency already (i.e. a `put` followed by a `get` on the same key returns the
        data stored by the `put` to all clients).  However, the driver must mask
        weak consistency by the storage provider if the provider cannot offer per-key
        read-your-writes consistency.
    
    * Authenticity.  Blockstack signs all data before giving it to
    the driver.  The driver does not need to implement separate
    authenticity checks.

    * Integrity.  Similarly, Blockstack ensures that the data hasn't
    been tampered with.  No action is required by the driver.

    * Data Confidentiality.  Blockstack encrypts data before giving it to
    the driver, and decrypts it after it loads it.  However, Blockstack
    does not guarantee that all the data it writes will be encrypted
    (i.e. the user or application may specify that it is "public" data).
    If this is unacceptable, then the driver may take its own additional
    steps to ensure data confidentiality.

    * Behavioral Confidentiality.  Blockstack does NOT take any action to
    hide network-visible access patterns.  Without assistance from the driver,
    someone watching the network can do timing analysis on the packets
    Blockstack sends and receives, and deduce things like the user's network
    location and the application being used.  If behavior confidentiality is
    required, then the driver must take additional steps to implement it.

    * Optimizations.  Things like write-batching, caching, write-deferrals, and
    so on are handled by Blockstack.  The driver should operate synchronously on 
    both gets and puts.  Specifically, the driver should NOT attempt to cache 
    reads, and the driver should NOT return from a put until the data is guaranteed
    to be durable.
